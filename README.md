# LCD_Touch_LibV2_STM32F4Discovery

LCD_Touch_LibV2_STM32F4Discovery is a small library that abstract the functions provided by element14 for its expansion set of the STM32F4 Discovery Board.

It allows to create and draw some kind of widgets, like buttons, textlines and labels.

The STMPE811QTR and stm32f4_discovery_lcd files are taken from the element14 demos, freely available in the relative website (even if the last file has been slightly modified, adding some functions).

Implements a layered widget structure based on a tree and provides a polling touchscreen support.
This library is part of the Industrial Application project of the Master Degree in Embedded Computing Systems (University of Pisa/Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna)
